 * executing.
 * This exeption will perform the context switch between two threads. Since 
 * it is running in an exception, the exeption will automatically stack some
 * registers. This is known as a stack frame. When the FPU is disabled the
 * exeption triggers the stacking of R0-R3, R12, LR, PC and xPSR. The exeption
 * handler stack the remainding register R4-R11 and switchs the stack pointer.
